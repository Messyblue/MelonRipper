# MelonRipper
Creates a .zip of the current eBook open on [MelonBooks](https://www.melonbooks.co.jp)'s browser viewer. 

Images are extracted from the canvases in focus, so you must manually flip the pages to keep saving. The pop-up menu will display whether or not a page has been saved and ready to be saved to a .zip file.

This browser extension is currently only compatible for Firefox.
